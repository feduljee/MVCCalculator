MVC Demonstration 

This is to demonstrate the Model View Controller architecture for a better understanding.  Using a calculator code, it is demonstrated how the code flows starting from the Controller.

Controller - The overall control-flow which begins from here.
View - The UI or View part handled here.
Model - Which is the business logic.
